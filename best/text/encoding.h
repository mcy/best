//! Unicode encodings.

///
/// A text encoding type. This type usually won't be used on its own; instead,
/// helpers from `best::rune` should be used instead.
///
/// A text encoding is any type that fulfills a contract in the spirit of the
/// "Lucky 7" encoding API from ztd.text.
/// <https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design/lucky%207.html>
///
/// To be supported by `best`, an encoding must be:
///
/// * Stateless. Decoding any one rune may not depend on what runes came
///   before it.
/// * Reversible. At any position within a stream, assuming it is a rune
///   boundary, it is possible to decode a unique rune in reverse order, and
///   reverse decoding agrees with forward decoding.
/// * Injective. Every rune is encoded as exactly one sequence of one or more
///   code units.
/// * ISO-646 compliant. Every printable ISO 646 character is encodable.
